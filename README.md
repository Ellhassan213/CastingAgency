# The Cool Casting Agency (^^)

The Cool Casting Agency models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. You are an Executive Producer within the company and are creating a system to simplify and streamline your process. 

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.9.2

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Environment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by navigating to the `/CastingAgency` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## Database Setup
With Postgres running, restore a database using the test_db.psql file provided. From the CastingAgency folder in terminal run:
```bash
psql casting_agency_db < test_db.psql
```

## Running the server

From within the `CastingAgency` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app,py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `app.py` directs flask to use the `CastingAgency` directory and the `app.py` file to find the application. 

#### Base URL

The app can be run locally, hosted at default http://127.0.0.1:5000/
The App is also deployed on Heroku, default at https://lawalcastingagency.herokuapp.com

#### API Keys/Authentication

This application is utilising Auth0 for Authentication.

## Auth0 Setup
1. Create an Auth0 account or use an existing one if you wish
2. Choose a unique tenant domain
3. Create a new Single Page Application for the Casting Agency
4. Create a new API for the Casting Agency
  - Navigate to API Settings
    1. Enable "RBAC"
    2. Enable "Add Permissions in the Access Token
    3. Set Token Expiration and Token Expiration for Browser Flows to value >= "80,000"
5. Navigate to API Permissions tab and create permissions below
```bash
  - get:movies
  - delete:movie
  - post:movie
  - patch:movie
  - get:actors
  - delete:actor
  - post:actor
  - patch:actor
```
6. Go to User Management -> Roles: Create the following roles
  - Casting Assistant
    - Can get:movies and get:actors
  - Casting Director
    - All permissions a casting assistance has and ...
    - post:actor or delete:actor
    - patch:movie or patch:actor
  - Executive Producer
    - All permissions a Casting Director has and ...
    - post:movie or delete:movie

7. Go to User Management -> Users
  - Create 3 seperate users
  - Assign each user with a role from step 6

## Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```bash
{
    "success": False,
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```

The app will return the following error types when request fail:

- 400: Bad request
- 401: No authorization
- 404: Resource not found
- 422: Unprocessable
- 405: Method not allowed
- 500: Internal server error

## Resource Endpoints

You can test endpoints using Curl, Postman or through the unit test integrated in the application.
The example requests provided using Curl were achieved by testing without the authentication layer.
A more complete test should be done using the other two methods.
